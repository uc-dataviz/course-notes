## Course description {-}

Social scientists frequently wish to convey information to a broader audience in a cohesive and interpretable manner. Visualizations are an excellent method to summarize information and report analysis and conclusions in a compelling format. This course introduces the theory and applications of data visualization. Students will learn techniques and methods for developing rich, informative and interactive, web-facing visualizations based on principles from graphic design and perceptual psychology. Students will practice these techniques on many types of social science data, including multivariate, temporal, geospatial, text, hierarchical, and network data. These techniques will be developed using a variety of software implementations such as R, ggplot2, D3, and Tableau.

## Prerequisites {-}

MACS 30500 or equivalent programming course in R. Prior experience with `ggplot2` is expected.

## What do I need for this course? {-}

Class sessions are a mix of lecture, demonstration, and live coding. It is essential to have a computer so you can follow along and complete the exercises. Before the course starts, you should install the following software on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - easiest approach is to select [a pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R. You could use base R, but you would regret it.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Comprehensive instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/#option-2-install-the-software-locally).

All readings (e.g., papers, book chapters) will be open source, with either links or citations provided.

## How will I be evaluated? {-}

## Statement on Disabilities {-}

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions.

This course is open to all students who meet the academic requirements for participation. Any student who has a documented need for accommodation should contact Student Disability Services (773-702-6000 or [disabilities@uchicago.edu](mailto:disabilities@uchicago.edu)) and provide us (Dr. Soltoff and Dr. Waggoner) with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter as soon as possible.
