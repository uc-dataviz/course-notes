## Course description {-}

This course introduces students to techniques for extracting and communicating knowledge from data. In the first half, students study visualizations as a method for summarizing information and reporting analysis and conclusions in a compelling format. This introduces the ideas and methods of data visualization, with emphasis on both why you are doing something as well as how to produce optimal visualizations. In the second half, students are introduced to the rapidly developing world of data mining. Focus will be on knowledge discovery and pattern recognition in the context of social science problem solving. From partitioning and anomaly detection to text clustering, high-dimensional mining, and deep learning, students will be given a thorough introduction to prominent techniques for exploring and discovering patterns in data. Throughout the course, class sessions will combine lecture, coding challenges, and computational problem solving to encourage wide engagement with the techniques using the R programming language.

## Prerequisites {-}

MACS 20500, CS 10121, or a similar introductory programming course. Experience in R is required. STAT 23400 or similar introductory statistics course is expected. Experience with machine learning is helpful but not required.

## What do I need for this course? {-}

Class sessions are a mix of lecture, demonstration, and live coding. It is essential to have a computer so you can follow along and complete the exercises. Before the course starts, you should install the following software on your computer:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - easiest approach is to select [a pre-compiled binary appropriate for your operating system](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
* [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) - this is a powerful user interface for programming in R. You could use base R, but you would regret it.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which is used to manage projects and track changes in computer files. Once installed, it can be integrated into RStudio to manage your course assignments and other projects.

Comprehensive instructions for downloading and setting up this software can be found [here](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/#option-2-install-the-software-locally).

All readings (e.g., papers, book chapters) will be open source, with either links or citations provided.

## How will I be evaluated? {-}

Students will submit daily problem sets each worth 100 points. Each assignment is due prior to the start of class (10 am CDT) the following day. There is no final exam or project in the course. Assignments will be submitted via GitHub Classroom.

## Statement on Disabilities {-}

The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions.

This course is open to all students who meet the academic requirements for participation. Any student who has a documented need for accommodation should contact Student Disability Services (773-702-6000 or [disabilities@uchicago.edu](mailto:disabilities@uchicago.edu)) and provide us (Dr. Soltoff and Dr. Waggoner) with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter as soon as possible.
